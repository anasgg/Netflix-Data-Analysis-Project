# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Netflix data using Python to answer a fundamental question: Has the average duration of movies on Netflix been declining over the years? Netflix, which originated in 1997 as a DVD rental service, has evolved into one of the largest entertainment and media companies globally.

## Introduction
