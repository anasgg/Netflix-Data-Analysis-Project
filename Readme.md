# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze Netflix data using Python to answer a fundamental question: Has the average duration of movies on Netflix been declining over the years? Netflix, which originated in 1997 as a DVD rental service, has evolved into one of the largest entertainment and media companies globally.

## Introduction
Explore the fascinating world of Netflix content by diving into the extensive collection of movies and series available on the platform. Leverage your exploratory data analysis skills to uncover insights into the entertainment industry. This project provides an opportunity to collaborate with a friend who has initiated the analysis by working with a CSV file containing Netflix data. The primary focus is on investigating whether there is a trend of decreasing movie lengths on Netflix and identifying potential contributing factors.

## Dataset
The dataset for this analysis is provided in the `netflix_data.csv` file. Below is a table detailing the column names and their descriptions:

### netflix_data.csv
| Column        | Description                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `show_id`     | The ID of the show            |
| `type`        | Type of show                  |
| `title`       | Title of the show             |
| `director`    | Director of the show          |
| `cast`        | Cast of the show              |
| `country`     | Country of origin             |
| `date_added`  | Date added to Netflix         |
| `release_year`| Year of Netflix release       |
| `duration`    | Duration of the show (minutes)|
| `description` | Description of the show       |
| `genre`       | Show genre                    |

## Objective
Your mission is to build on your friend's initial research and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix data. Specifically, focus on determining whether the average duration of movies has been decreasing over the years. Provide insights and explanations for any observed trends, considering various factors that may contribute to changes in movie lengths.


## Getting Started
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Download the `netflix_data.csv` file.
3. Set up your Python environment with the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib).
4. Explore the dataset and implement your analysis in the provided Jupyter notebook or script.

## Analysis Steps
1. Load the dataset and familiarize yourself with the structure.
2. Clean and preprocess the data as needed.
3. Explore the distribution of movie durations.
4. Analyze trends in movie lengths over the years.
5. Identify factors that may contribute to changes in movie durations.
6. Visualize your findings using appropriate plots and charts.

## Conclusion
Summarize your findings and provide a conclusion regarding whether there is evidence supporting the claim that the average duration of movies on Netflix has been decreasing. Discuss any insights gained from the analysis and potential implications for the entertainment industry.
